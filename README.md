# Lending Default Prediction (Deep Learning with Keras and TensorFlow)

# Problem Statement

For companies like Lending Club correctly predicting whether or not a loan will be a default is very important. 
In this project, using historical data from 2007 to 2015, I had to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans. 
As you will see later, this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.

# Problem Objective

Created a model that predicts whether or not a loan will be default using historical data.

# Domain: Finance

# Analysis

Performed data preprocessing and built a deep learning prediction model.

# Content: Dataset columns and definition

● credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise.

● purpose: The purpose of the loan (takes values "credit_card", "debt_consolidation", "educational", "major_purchase", "small_business", and "all_other").

● int.rate: The interest rate of the loan, as a proportion (a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11). Borrowers judged by LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates.

● installment: The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded.

● log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower.

● dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (the amount of debt divided by annual income).

● fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower.

● days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line.

● revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance (the amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle).

● revol.util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate (the amount of the credit line used relative to total credit available).

● inq.last.6mths: The borrower's number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months.

● delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower has been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years.

● pub.rec: The borrower's number of derogatory public records (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments).

● not.fully.paid: 0 → The loan was fully paid. 1 → The loan was not fully paid (i.e., defaulted, charged off, or missed payments).

# Steps Performed

Performed exploratory data analysis and feature engineering and then apply feature engineering. 
Followed up with a deep learning model to predict whether or not the loan will be default using the historical data.

# Tasks

1. Feature Transformation: Transformed categorical values into numerical values (discrete)
2. Exploratory data analysis of different factors in the dataset.
3. Additional Feature Engineering: I checked the correlation between features and dropped those features that have a strong correlation. This will help reduce the number of features and leave me with the most relevant features.
4. Modeling: After applying EDA and feature engineering, I was now ready to build the predictive models. In this part, I created a deep learning model using Keras with Tensorflow backend.
